def split_message(messageText, max_consecutive_comment=12, max_consecutive_whitespace=3):
    """Split the message into main body and the footer.

:param str messageText: The text to process.
:param int max_consecutive_comment: The maximum number of lines of quoting to allow before snipping.
:param int max_consecutive_whitespace: The maximum number of lines that just contain whitespace to
    allow before snipping.
:returns: 2-tuple, containing the strings representing the main-body of the message, and the footer.
:rtype: :class:`SplitMessage`

Email messages often contain a footer at the bottom, which identifies the user, and who they work
for. However, GroupServer has lovely profiles which do this, so normally we want to snip the footer,
to reduce clutter.

In addition, many users only write a short piece of text at the top of the email, while the
remainder of the message consists of all the previous posts. This method also removes the
*bottom quoting*.
