I had a quick chance to peak at my Notification sample.
Mine is at: http://groupserver.org/p/stevenc/gs-profile-status.html

Swap out stevenc for your profile link name.
Other than wishing active groups were at the top, this text …
“You get quite a lot of email! Switch to digest mode
[development%40groupserver.org?Subject=Digest%20on&body=Hello%2C%0A%0APlease%20set%20me%20to%20digest-mode%20for%20GroupServer%20development%0A%3Chttp%3A//groupserver.org/groups/development%3E.%0A%0A--%0ASteven%20Clift%20%3Chttp%3A//groupserver.org/p/stevenc%3E] and you will get a single daily summary of what is going on in GroupServer development , instead of an email each time someone posts.”
… may run counter to the goals of fostering active groups.
In short, proactively encouraging people to switch to digest essentially causes
us to lose much of their participation. Out of sight, out of mind.
Obviously we need digest to keep people who hate email in the loop, but I would
rather see … “your group isn’t too active, click here to not miss a message by
getting posts immediately.”

it will only go out to all members of this group (GroupServer Development) and
OnlineGroups.net Administrators . This will *hopefully* allow me to deal with most of the issues before sending
it out to the wider audience on 1 July.
