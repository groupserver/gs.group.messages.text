I agree wholeheartedly - what a stupid idea to block that intersection & not allow that turn.  Now to get onto either I94 or to Hwy 280, you must drive to Raymond & wait to turn left - either pulling a U turn or being forced to drive a block north to get back to either on-ramps.  I am frequently at both Memorial Blood Center and at Jimmy Johns so I am one of those that makes the illegal left turn regularly.  If ever pulled over for it, I'll happily go fight it - but probably should bring it to the city's attention before going to those lengths I suppose.

During my trip past the goofy obstacle, I witnessed 2 vehicles drive around the barrier, disregard the no left-turn sign, and make what is now apparently an illegal left turn.  How else would anyone get from northbound Pelham to westbound Franklin?
